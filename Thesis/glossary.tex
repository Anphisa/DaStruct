\newglossaryentry{working memory}{
	name={working memory}, 
	description={is the part of human memory between sensory information and long term memory. Information 	that is to be included in long term memory is selected here, so the working memory acts as a sort of 			buffer. According to \cite{Baddeley.2007} it is divided into three subcomponents, one of which is the 		visuospatial sketchpad, which is responsible for storing visual and spatial information. Working 			memory has limited capacity, \cite{Miller.1956}'s law states that this capacity is 7 $\pm$ 2, i.e. any 		individual can keep about 7 objects concurrently in their working memory}
